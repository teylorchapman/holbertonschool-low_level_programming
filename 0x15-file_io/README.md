Code should be verified in Betty compliance with ```betty```

The only C standard library functions allowed are ```malloc```, ```free```, and ```exit```
Any use of functions like ```prinf```, ```puts```, ```calloc```, ```realloc```, etc...is forbidden

Allowed syscalls: ```open```, ```close```, ```read```, ```write```
