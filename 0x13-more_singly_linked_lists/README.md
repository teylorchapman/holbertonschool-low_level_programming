# :sparkles: This is the C - More Singly Linked Lists project for Holberton Schools Tulsa :sparkles:

## Objectives:

* How to use linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

### Requirements:

Files will be compiled with ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```

Code should be verified in Betty compliance with ```betty```

The only C standard library functions allowed are ```malloc```, ```free```, and ```exit```
Any use of functions like ```prinf```, ```puts```, ```calloc```, ```realloc```, etc...is forbidden

```putchar``` is  allowed

## Questions:

0. Print list
    * write a function that prints all the elements of a ```listint_t``` list.

1. List Length
    * write a functiton that returns the number of elements in a linked ```listint_t``` list.
    
2. Add Node
    * write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a ```listint_t``` list.

3. Add Node at the End
    * write a function that adds a new node at the end of a ```listint_t``` list.

4. Free List
    * write a function that frees a ```listint_t``` list.

5. Free
    * write a function that frees a ```listint_t``` list.

6. Pop
    * write a function that deletes the head node of a ```listint_t``` linked list, and returns the head node's data (n).

7. Get node at index
    * write a function that returns the nth node of a ```listint_t``` linked list.

8. Sum list
    * write a function that returns the sum of all the date (n) of a ```listint_t``` linked list.

9. Insert
    * write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

10. Delete at index
    * write a function that deletes the node at index ```index``` of a ```listint_t``` linked list.
