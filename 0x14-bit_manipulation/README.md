# :sparkles: This is the C - Bit Manipulation project for Holberton Schools :sparkles:

## Objectives:

* Look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators


### Requirements:

Files will be compiled with ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```

Code should be verified in Betty compliance with ```betty```

The only C standard library functions allowed are ```malloc```, ```free```, and ```exit```
Any use of functions like ```prinf```, ```puts```, ```calloc```, ```realloc```, etc...is forbidden

```putchar``` is  allowed


## Questions:

0. 0
    * write a function that converts a binary number to an ```unsigned int```

1. 1
    * write a function that prints the binary representation of a number

2. 10
    * write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index

3. 11
    * write a function that sets the value of a bit to ```1``` at a given index

4. 100
    * write a function that sets the value of a bit to ```0``` at a given index

5. 101
    * write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
