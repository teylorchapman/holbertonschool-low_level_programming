# :sparkles: This is the C - Singly Linked Lists project for Holberton Schools Tulsa :sparkles:

## Objectives:

    * When and why use linked lists vs arrays
    * How to build and used linked lists.

### Requirements:

Files will be compiled with ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```

Code should be verified in Betty compliance with ```betty```

The only C standard library functions allowed are ```malloc```, ```free```, and ```exit```
Any use of functions like ```prinf```, ```puts```, ```calloc```, ```realloc```, etc...is forbidden

```putchar``` is  allowed

## Questions:

    0. Print list
        * write a function that prints all the elements of a ```list_t``` list.
    
    1. List Length
        * write a functiton that returns the number of elements in a linked ```list_t``` list.
    
    2. Add Node
        * write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a ```list_t``` list.

    3. Add Node at the End
        * write a function that adds a new node at the end of a ```list_t``` list.

    4. Free List
        * write a function that frees a ```list_t``` list.
